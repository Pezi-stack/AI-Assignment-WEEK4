Part 3: Ethical Reflection (10%)
Potential Biases and Mitigation Strategies:
Dataset Biases:

Demographic Underrepresentation: If training data primarily comes from specific geographic regions or demographic groups, the model may perform poorly for underrepresented populations

Temporal Bias: Historical data may reflect outdated practices or biases that shouldn't be perpetuated

Measurement Bias: Features might be proxies for sensitive attributes (e.g., certain code patterns correlating with team composition)

IBM AI Fairness 360 Mitigation:

Bias Detection: Use fairness metrics to identify disparate impact across different groups

Pre-processing: Apply reweighting or disparate impact remover to create balanced datasets

In-processing: Use adversarial debiasing during model training to remove sensitive attribute influence

Post-processing: Calibrate decision thresholds to ensure equitable outcomes across groups

Implementation Approach:

Regular fairness audits using multiple metrics

Diverse stakeholder review of model outcomes

Transparent documentation of limitations and biases

Continuous monitoring for drift and emerging biases



Bonus Task: Innovation Proposal
AI-Powered Technical Debt Assessment Tool

Purpose:
Automatically identify, quantify, and prioritize technical debt in codebases using static analysis and machine learning.

Workflow:

Code Analysis: Parse codebase to detect anti-patterns, code smells, and complexity hotspots

ML Classification: Categorize debt types (architecture, test, documentation, code quality)

Impact Prediction: Estimate maintenance costs and bug probability for debt items

Prioritization Engine: Recommend remediation order based on business impact

Key Features:

Integration with CI/CD pipelines

Technical debt visualization dashboards

Refactoring suggestion generator

ROI calculator for debt repayment

Impact:

Reduce maintenance costs by 30-40%

Improve code quality metrics

Enable data-driven refactoring decisions

Enhance developer productivity and satisfaction
